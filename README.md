# 🎨 Color Palette Extraction & Map Visualization

This project demonstrates a simple workflow for extracting a custom color palette from an image and applying it in cartographic design.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of the project is to create a coherent, visually pleasing color palette derived from a chosen artwork/image and use it in a thematic map. The process includes selecting an image, extracting colors, compiling them into a presentation, and applying the palette in map design.

## 🧩 Workflow
### 1️⃣ Image Selection

I chose an artwork that visually appealed to me and had a strong, recognizable color structure.

### 2️⃣ Color Extraction

Using **Adobe Color**, I manually extracted the dominant colors from the image, one by one, ensuring they represent the overall mood and tone.

### 3️⃣ Map Design

The custom color palette was applied to a map composition, ensuring consistent thematic styling and strong visual identity.

### 4️⃣ Palette Presentation (PDF)

The extracted colors and map were arranged and organized into a clean PDF palette presentation, showing the final results.
